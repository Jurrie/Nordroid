    <p>This is the website of Nordroid. Basically, it's more like a placeholder for the (mandatory) <a href="privacypolicy.html">privacy policy</a>.</p>
    <p>Nordroid is meant to become a full Android port of Clavia's <a href="https://www.nordkeyboards.com/software/nord-sound-manager/">Nord Sound Manager</a>.</p>
    <p>Though it still has a long way to go. For now, this app only supports the <a href="https://www.nordkeyboards.com/products/nord-electro-6/">Nord Electro 6D</a>, because that's the only device I have access to.</p>
    <p>Please know this before using this app:
      <ul>
        <li>This app is not created by Clavia DMI AB. Please do not bug them with questions related to this app.</li>
        <li>I am a single developer who has created this app in his spare time. I'll do my best to fix bugs where I can, but I do not have unlimited time or resources, and I do not own Nord devices myself. (So yes: I keep bugging the keyboard player of my band to borrow his Nord Electro 6D ðŸ˜€)</li>
        <li>I test this app against a real device. I think it is safe to use, but in the very unlikely event that it crashes your device, I can not be held responsible.</li>
        <li>Found a bug, or missing a feature? Please head over to the GitHub page and create an issue there.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>If you have a bug or a feature request, please head over to the GitHub repository, and <a href="https://github.com/Jurrie/Nordroid/issues">create an issue</a>.</p>
